### âœ… 7. Hugging Face Spaces Deployment

Hugging Face Spaces supports **FastAPI** apps via **Gradio** or `app.py`. You'll need:

1. Push the code to a GitHub repo.
2. Create a new Space on Hugging Face with:
   - **Type**: "Gradio" or "Static"
   - **SDK**: `fastapi`
3. Set `app.py` as the entry point.
4. Commit and push the code with a `README.md`, and Hugging Face will auto-deploy.

Would you like me to:
- Generate the full zipped project structure?
- Set up a GitHub repo template for you?
- Prepare a `Dockerfile` for portable deployment?

Let me know your next move, I can prep it for you fast.
